This repository contains a cheat mod for Sid Meier's Civilization VII.

## Mod Description

This mod adds various cheat projects to the cities. Only human players can receive rewards.

## Projects

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Boost City Yields | Continuously grants +900% Food, Production, Gold, Science, Culture, Happiness, and Influence to the city. You can cancel this at any time. |
| Boost Player Yields | Continuously grants +900% Gold, Science, Culture, and Influence to the player. You can cancel this at any time. |
| Enhance Player Units | Continuously grants +10 Range, +100 Healing, +10 Moves, and +10 Sight Range to all player Units. You can cancel this at any time. |
| Acquire Wildcard Attribute Points | Gain +10 Wildcard Attribute Points upon completion. |
| Acquire Gold | Gain +10000 Gold upon completion. |
| Reveal Map | Reveals the entire map upon completion. |

## Known Issues

- The English descriptions are currently being revised for clarity and naturalness.
- The Reveal Map project may reappear in city projects after an age transition. This is a known issue and can be safely ignored.
- An incorrect description states that projects require a city population of 7 or higher. There are no population requirements for these projects.
- Activating multiple 'Enhance Player Units' projects while trade routes are active may significantly lengthen turn times due to the lack of a quick movement option in the base game.
- Need to verify that the AI players do not perform the projects added by this mod.
